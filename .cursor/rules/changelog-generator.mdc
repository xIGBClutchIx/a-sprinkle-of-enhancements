# Cursor Rule: Modpack Update Changelog Generation

When generating a changelog for a modpack update, follow this structure:

1.  **Main Title**:
    *   Start with a markdown H1 heading: `# [Version Number] Update`
        *   Example: `# 1.21.5 Update`

2.  **General Update Summary**:
    *   Immediately following the title, provide 1-3 bullet points summarizing the high-level changes.
    *   These should be broad statements about the nature of the update.
    *   Examples:
        *   `- Updated existing mods to their latest versions for improved performance and compatibility.`
        *   `- Updated resource packs and shader configurations for better visuals.`
        *   `- Addressed several bug fixes and stability issues.`

3.  **Mod Changes Section**:
    *   Add a markdown H2 heading: `## Mod Changes`

4.  **Added Mods Sub-section**:
    *   Under "Mod Changes," add a markdown H3 heading: `### Added`
    *   List each newly added mod as a bullet point.
    *   Format: `- **[Mod Name]** - [Brief description of mod and its purpose, including any relevant context like OS specificity].`
    *   Example: `- **DarkTitleBar** - A new mod to make the window title bar dark for a consistent theme (primarily for Windows).`
    *   If no mods were added, this section can be omitted or state "None."

5.  **Removed Mods Sub-section**:
    *   Following "Added" (or directly under "Mod Changes" if nothing was added), add a markdown H3 heading: `### Removed`
    *   List each removed mod as a bullet point.
    *   Format: `- **[Mod Name]** - [Brief description of the mod that was removed].`
    *   Example: `- **ModernFix** - This optimization mod has been removed from the pack.`
    *   If no mods were removed, this section can be omitted or state "None."

# A Sprinkle of Enhancements

This modpack is just your normal optimization-based modpack with a few visual adjustments such as shaders, falling leaves, faithful resource pack, dark UI pack, eating animations, autorunning, and includes a realistic sound reverb mod!

Everything you see in this pack should work completely fine on Vanilla servers! This modpack will not add anything such as minimaps or other things that go against the spirit of Vanilla Minecraft.
